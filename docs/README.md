## Project Overview

The Relationship Dashboard is a web application that provides insights and analysis of relationship-related discussions from online forums. It helps users understand trends, common issues, and sentiment within these communities.

The project is divided into two main components:

-   **Frontend:** A Next.js application that provides the user interface for the dashboard.
-   **Backend:** A Node.js application that provides a RESTful API to the frontend.

## Getting Started
